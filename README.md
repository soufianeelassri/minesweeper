# Minesweeper Game

Welcome to the Minesweeper game repository! This project is developed in C as part of the Algorithmics module, supervised by Professor Mohammed KASRI at ENSIASD - TAROUDANT for the academic year 2023/2024.

## Project Description

The goal of the project is to create a single-player version of Minesweeper. Navigate through a grid filled with hidden mines, revealing squares and avoiding mines to win the game.

## Gameplay

- **Revealing Squares**: Uncover squares to reveal numbers indicating the nearby mines or risk triggering a mine.
- **Flagging Mines**: Mark potential mine locations with flags to aid your strategy.
- **Difficulty Levels**: Choose from three difficulty levels, adjusting the challenge by varying the number of mines.
- **End of Game**: Win by successfully uncovering all non-mine squares, or lose by triggering a mine.
